**Reinforcement learning** is a type of **artificial intelligence** that tries to determine the **best action for an agent to take in a given state based on immediate and cumulative rewards.** It is used in many different fields including **game theory**, **statistics**, **control theory**, and **simulation-based optimization**. In general reinforcement learning is **unsupervised**, meaning that it is never shown the **“correct answer”** to make adjustments to its parameters. Reinforcement learning agents usually use a **Markov decision process (MDP)** to select the best action for the state they are in (or, more generally, to form a policy for choosing actions based on the state). In an MDP, given a state and an action, the state transitions are conditionally independent of all previous states and actions.

For Pacman, the actions are simple: **North, South, East, West, or Stop**. The rewards are also simple: **food is +10, ghosts are -500 or +200, depending, and a win is +500**. The states, however, get tricky. On a large board, Pacman is essentially operating in a continuous state space. We abstracted states to mean linear combinations of features instead of Pacman’s coordinates on the board.

The picture above shows the action space, which consists of five actions: North, South, East, West, and Stop.

**Q learning** is a type of reinforcement learning algorithm. It calculates the quantity of a state-action combination. Each time the agent selects an action it observes a reward and enters a new state. **The Q-value is updated based on the new information. Next action is selected based on the Q value so that the agent gets as much reward as possible.**
