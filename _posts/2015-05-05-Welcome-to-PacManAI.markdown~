	We are Stephanie Northway, Kelly Brennan and Pinar Demetci. This is our course project for Software Design course at Olin College of Engineering.
 We have used machine learning for the computer to strategize and learn to win the PacMan game. 
	Our learning goals were mostly related to learning machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms. Therefore, we decided to focus on implementing algorithms instead of creating the game environment. 
	For the game itself, we used the code provided in [UC Berkeley's CS188 Intro to AI code]().
