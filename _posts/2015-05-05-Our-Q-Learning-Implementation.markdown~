On a large board, PacMan esentially operates in a continuous state space. In such a space, implementing Q values in a matrix is not viable. To address this, we have abstracted states to linear combinations of features instead of PacMan's coordinates on the board.

Learning happens when the agent updates the weights associated with each feature after every move and learns which features to prioritize. This makes the approximated Q value converge to the real Q value.

The features we have included are: 
- Nearest capsule distance
- Food pellet distance
- Nearest ghost distance
- Nearest scared ghost distance
- Score

Our code architecture is explained in the diagram below. The classes we have implemented are "Features", whis is the super class of all the features used in Q value approximation and SimpleQAgent, which is the learning agent. The other classes create the game environment.
