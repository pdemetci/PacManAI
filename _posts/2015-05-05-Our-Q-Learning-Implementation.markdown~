On a large board, PacMan esentially operates in a continuous state space. In such a space, implementing Q values in a matrix is not viable. To address this, we have abstracted states to linear combinations of features instead of PacMan's coordinates on the board and stored Q-value as a result of the ...

Learning happens when agent updates the weights of the features

For further information on Q learning in continuous spaces, you can download and check Hado van Hasselt's paper on [Reinforcement Learning in
Continuous State and Action Spaces](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~vanhasse/papers/RL_in_Continuous_Spaces.pdf)
