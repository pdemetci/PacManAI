# Project Proposal:

- Big Idea:  We aim to implement computer learning to strategize and win Pacman game. We’ll be exploring AI concepts to develop game strategies.
- MVP: Plays pacman without the ghosts and implements pathfinding and a simple AI strategy to consume food in the shortest amount of time
- Stretched goals: Plays pacman well with ghosts. Implement a neural network

## Learning Goals:
- Kelly - Getting more experience with object oriented programming; data processing; learn about machine learning; think about other applications of machine learning; gain more confidence coding and experience debugging; working with github efficiently 
- Pinar - Learning about AI, machine learning and algorithms, practicing object-oriented programming, collaborative coding and using GitHub effectively.
- Steph - Learning AI concepts, being a decent team member on a software project, writing good tests and documentation
- Shared - Learning AI concepts, being good collaborators and teammates

## Implementation Plan: 
Identified a library or framework that you think will be useful for you project. If you don’t have any idea how you will implement your project, provide a rough plan for how you will determine this information


The framework laid out in Berkeley’s CS188 class (http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html) will provide us with sufficient scaffolding, including an implementation of the Pacman game in Python, to get started. There may even be a bit too much scaffolding in the course materials; we will discuss as a team how much of it we want to make use of. We will likely use the numpy and scipy libraries for the machine learning part of the project.

## Project Schedule: 

### Week 1: 
- Start the Machine Learning and AI and Algorithms toolbox
- Set up Github, install numpy/scipy
- Go through the Berkely CS188 site to see what is available, decide what to use (Individual)

### Week 2:  
- Start the skeleton of the website.
- First stab at architecture
- Keeping track of Pacman location and begin AI in finding food
- Design Review

### Week 3: 
- Have MVP
- Code Review
- UML diagram
- Decide which advanced learning strategy we want to use
- Work on website

### Week 4: 
- Working on advanced learning strategy
- Continue website development

### Week 5:
- “Mid”-Project Presentation (4/23)
- Continue website development

### Week 6: 
- Finishing touches on code and website
- Final poster and demo session (Wednesday, May 6th from 4pm - 7pm)

### Collaboration Plan:
- Have formal weekly meetings Sundays 3-5pm and informal meetings on Wednesdays 9pm-12am when we can
- Work on implementing specific parts of program between meetings
- Pair programming during weekly meetings
- Software development strategies
- Pair programming during meetings
- Good Git practices: feature branches and pull requests

### Risks: 
- AI/machine learning is hard! It may be a little much for us to implement a successful AI in 6 weeks. Also, relying on Berkeley’s code and having to go through and understand it could be a bottleneck. Leaving the website development into the end. Senioritis.

### Additional Course Content: 
- Covering more AI and machine learning related concepts -additional to the toolboxes- would be useful. 
- Coding/data processing efficiency
